Tips: 
1. NO_DOMAIN_NAME_FOUND means DNS record is already cached by System/Application or Application uses IP address to make the connection directly.
2. For Chrome, please disable its internal DNS.
3. For some brands of phone, please grant Fiwalld background running permission to make sure it will not be stopped by the System.
4. Monitoring screen shows latest 300 network activities.
5. If you receive a system prompt that Fiwalld is draining battery, don't panic. Fiwalld does the connecting work, while other applications save this part of the battery, so the overall battery consumption remains the same.
